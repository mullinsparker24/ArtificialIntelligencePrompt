# ArtificialIntelligencePrompt

# Imported the FoodX.csv file and identified the predictors as year, major, university, and time
# Converted each string into a unique int value in order for the model to work (i.e. year 1 becomes 0)
# Made a training and testing set, and made sure to delete the training data from the testing set before testing
# Tested the model using different models such as RandomForestRegressor
# Created a heatmap to see how the predictors are related to each other
